# Captionix---AI-Based-Image-Analysis-and-Caption-Generation-System
Captionix is an intelligent image understanding system developed using Python that integrates Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI techniques to analyze and interpret visual content.

The system takes an image as input and performs three major tasks:
    Image Classification
    Object Detection
    Image Caption Generation

Before model training, data analysis and visualization techniques are applied to explore the dataset, analyze class distribution, and understand image characteristics. This ensures proper data understanding and preprocessing, which are essential components of Data Science.

The project demonstrates how multiple AI technologies can be integrated into a single unified system to achieve automated visual understanding. It provides a real-world example of how modern AI systems interpret images similar to human perception.
