# Captionix

### AI-Based Image Analysis and Caption Generation System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Captionix** is an intelligent image understanding system developed using **Python** that integrates **Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI** into a single unified application.

The system accepts an image as input and performs automated visual analysis by classifying the image, detecting objects within it, and generating a meaningful natural language caption that describes the scene. This project demonstrates how modern AI techniques can be combined to achieve human-like image interpretation.
